## What is Server-Driven UI?
Server-Driven UI (SDUI) is an approach that allows the user interface (UI) of mobile or web applications to be controlled and updated dynamically by a server. In traditional mobile apps, the UI is fixed on the client side, and any changes require an app update. However, with SDUI, the server determines the structure and content of the UI dynamically and sends it to the client. This way, updates can be applied without releasing a new app version.
